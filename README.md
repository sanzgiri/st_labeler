# st_labeler

This repo houses a number of Streamlit apps that make use of the Session State hack:

* label_videos.py: An app to crowdsource labeling of videos
* mathquiz.py: A basic quiz interface using Streamlit
* jeopardy.py: An app that makes use of the Jeopardy archive to generate questions for practice (inspired by the Jeoparty slack bot). This app is hosted here: https://share.streamlit.io/sanzgiri/st_labeler/jeopardy.py. To do:
 - Restrict questions from recent past
 - Allow restricting questions from specific topics (e.g Shakespeare, Before-And-After style) or high value / final jeopardy questions.
